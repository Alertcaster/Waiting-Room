Waiting-Room
============

Waiting Room alerts office members that their visitor is waiting at the reception or front desk via Email, SMS and/or a Phone Call.

This is the Alertcaster API in Javascript.  You can drop it on your own server and go ahead and use the page.  If you want this to work in
Python, Perl, Ruby, etc., just rewrite from what you see in the Javascript.  If you do re-write, please commit your rewrite
for that language for others to use.

To activate this API, you'll need to sign-up for an Alertcaster account at developer.alertcaster.com.  Once signed up, go to the 
Developer Guide link and get your API Key. If you want to make a phone call from this API, you'll need to upload an audio file
and make sure you put the audio file AudioID into the API.

Let us know how it works.
